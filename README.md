# Twitter-Backend

Here I worked with three other students to implement a mock twitter backend in node. The functionailty includes creating an account, logging in, following people, tweeting,
favoriting tweets, viewing tweets, direct messenging people, posting images and more. We worked failry hard on this project, and are all proud of how it tunred out.
